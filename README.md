## XP Calculation Algorithm

The XP system rewards users based on multiple factors:

1. **Base XP**: 10% of calories burned
2. **Age Bonus**: 2% bonus per year over 18 (encourages fitness at any age)
3. **Duration Bonus**: 2 XP per minute of workout time
4. **Exercise Variety**: 3 XP per unique muscle group targeted
5. **Difficulty Bonus**: 1-4 XP based on exercise difficulty level

### Example XP Calculation
For a 45-year-old user doing a 30-minute workout with 3 exercises targeting different muscle groups:
- Base calories: 300 â†’ 30 XP
- Age bonus (45-18 = 27 years): 27 Ã— 0.02 = 54% bonus â†’ 46 XP
- Duration bonus: 30 minutes Ã— 2 = 60 XP
- Variety bonus: 3 muscle groups Ã— 3 = 9 XP
- Difficulty bonus: 6 XP (average)
- **Total: 121 XP**
